A framework for performing volatile-testing experiments.

To use:

  + Decide on the name of your Emulab experiment.  Let's assume that you call
    decide to call it "exp" to run it in the "randtest" project.

  + Create a "bootstrap" file for your experiment.  Copy `scripts/bootstrap.sh'
    to Emulab: put it in the `startcmds' subdirectory of your project directory
    and give it a name to match your experiment.  So, for our example:

	scp -p scripts/bootstrap.sh \
	  users.emulab.net:/proj/randtest/startcmds/exp.sh

  + Use `ns/ubuntu12-pc3000.ns' or one of the other NS files to create and
    swap-in an Emulab experiment.

  + Login to your experiment:

	ssh imp.exp.randtest.emulab.net

  + Declare where to find the node-local clone of this repository:

	export VOLTEST_HOME=/disk2/randtest/src/voltest

  + Set up your environment (if you wish; scripts set their own):

	. $VOLTEST_HOME/scripts/env.sh

  + Install and configure the volatile-testing test harness:

	$VOLTEST_HOME/scripts/setup.sh

  + Run the test harness:

	$VOLTEST_HOME/scripts/run.sh

To learn where things go, see `$VOLTEST_HOME/scripts/vars.sh'.
