A framework for performing volatile-testing experiments.

To use:

  + Use `ns/ubuntu12-pc3000.ns' to create and swap-in an Emulab experiment.
    Let's assume that you call it "exp", in project "randtest".

  + Login to your experiment:

	ssh imp.exp.randtest.emulab.net

  + Declare where to find a clone of this repository:

	export VOLTEST_HOME=/proj/randtest/voltest

  + Set up your environment (if you wish; scripts set their own):

	. $VOLTEST_HOME/scripts/env.sh

  + Install and configure the volatile-testing test harness:

	$VOLTEST_HOME/scripts/setup.sh

  + Run the test harness:

	$VOLTEST_HOME/scripts/run.sh

To learn where things go, see `$VOLTEST_HOME/scripts/vars.sh'.
